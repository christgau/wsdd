# wsdd

wsdd implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon. This enables (Samba)
hosts, like your local NAS device, to be found by Web Service Discovery Clients
like Windows.

It also implements the client side of the discovery protocol which allows to
search for Windows machines and other devices implementing WSD. This mode of
operation is called discovery mode.

# Purpose

Since NetBIOS discovery is not supported by Windows anymore, wsdd makes hosts
to appear in Windows again using the Web Service Discovery method. This is
beneficial for devices running Samba, like NAS or file sharing servers on your
local network. The discovery mode searches for other WSD servers in the local
subnet.

## Background

With Windows 10 version 1511, support for SMBv1 and thus NetBIOS device discovery
was disabled by default.  Depending on the actual edition, later versions of
Windows starting from version 1709 ("Fall Creators Update") do not allow the
installation of the SMBv1 client anymore.  This causes hosts running Samba not
to be listed in the Explorer's "Network (Neighborhood)" views. While there is no
connectivity problem and Samba will still run fine, users might want to have
their Samba hosts to be listed by Windows automatically.

You may ask: What about Samba itself, shouldn't this functionality be included
in Samba!? Yes, maybe. However, using Samba as file sharing service is still
possible even if the host running Samba is not listed in the Network
Neighborhood. You can still connect using the host name (given that name
resolution works) or IP address. So you can have network drives and use shared
folders as well. In addition, there is a patch lurking around in the Samba
bug tracker since 2015. So it may happen that this feature gets integrated into
Samba at some time in the future.

# Requirements

wsdd requires Python 3.7 and later only. It runs on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and MacOS.
Other Unixes, such as NetBSD, might work as well but were not tested.

Although Samba is not strictly required by wsdd itself, it makes sense to run
wsdd only on hosts with a running Samba daemon. Note that the OpenRC/Gentoo
init script depends on the Samba service.

# Installation

## Operating System and Distribution-Depending Instructions

This section provides instructions how to install wsdd on different OS distributions.
Sufficient privileges are assumed to be in effect, e.g. by being root or using sudo.

### Arch Linux

Install wsdd from the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/wsdd.git).

### CentOS, Fedora, RHEL

wsdd is included in RedHat/CentOS' EPEL repository. After [setting that up](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/), you
can install wsdd like on Fedora where it is sufficient to issue

```
dnf install wsdd
```

### Debian-based Distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, ...)

Wsdd is included in the official package repositories of Debian and Ubuntu
(*universe*) since versions 12 (*Bookworm*) and 22.04 LTS (*Jammy Jellyfish*),
respectively.  This also applies to Linux Mint, starting from version 21
(Vanessa).  Thus, it is sufficient to install it via

```
apt install wsdd
```

### FreeBSD

The wsdd port can be installed via

```
pkg install py39-wsdd
```

### Gentoo

You can choose between two overlays: the GURU project and an [author-maintained
dedicated overlay](https://github.com/christgau/wsdd-gentoo) which can be selected as follows

```
emerge eselect-repository
eselect repository enable guru
emerge --sync
```

After setting up one of them you can install wsdd with

```
emerge wsdd
```

## Generic Installation Instructions

No installation steps are required. Just place the wsdd.py file anywhere you
want to, rename it to wsdd, and run it from there. The init scripts/unit files
assume that wsdd is installed under `/usr/bin/wsdd` or `/usr/local/bin/wsdd` in
case of FreeBSD. There are no configuration files. No special privileges are
required to run wsdd, so it is advisable to run the service as an unprivileged,
possibly dedicated, user for the service.

The `etc` directory of the repo contains sample configuration files for
different init(1) systems, e.g. FreeBSD's rc.d, Gentoo's openrc, and systemd
which is used in most contemporary Linux distros. Those files may be used as
templates. They are likely to require adjustments to the actual
distribution/installation where they are to be used.

# Usage

## Firewall Setup

Traffic for the following ports, directions and addresses must be allowed.

 * incoming and outgoing traffic to udp/3702 with multicast destination:
   - `239.255.255.250` for IPv4
   - `ff02::c` for IPv6
 * outgoing unicast traffic from udp/3702
 * incoming to tcp/5357

You should further restrict the traffic to the (link-)local subnet, e.g. by
using the `fe80::/10` address space for IPv6. Please note that IGMP traffic
must be enabled in order to get IPv4 multicast traffic working.

For UFW and firewalld, application/service profiles can be found in the respective directories.
Note that UFW profiles only allow to grant the traffic on specific UDP and TCP
ports, but a restriction on the IP range (like link local for IPv6) or the
multicast traffic is not possible.

## Options

By default wsdd runs in host mode and binds to all interfaces with only
warnings and error messages enabled. In this configuration the host running
wsdd is discovered with its configured hostname and belong to a default
workgroup. The discovery mode, which allows to search for other WSD-compatible
devices must be enabled explicitly. Both modes can be used simultaneously. See
below for details.

### General options

 * `-4`, `--ipv4only` (see below)
 * `-6`, `--ipv6only`

     Restrict to the given address family. If both options are specified no
     addreses will be available and wsdd will exit.

 * `-A`, `--no-autostart`
     Do not start networking activities automatically when the program is started.
	 The API interface (see man page) can be used to start and stop the
	 networking activities while the application is running.

 * `-c DIRECTORY`, `--chroot DIRECTORY`

     Chroot into a separate directory to prevent access to other directories of
     the system. This increases security in case of a vulnerability in wsdd.
     Consider setting the user and group under which wssd is running by using
     the `-u` option.

 * `-H HOPLIMIT`, `--hoplimit HOPLIMIT`

     Set the hop limit for multicast packets. The default is 1 which should
     prevent packets from leaving the local network segment.

 * `-i INTERFACE/ADDRESS`, `--interface INTERFACE/ADDRESS`

     Specify on which interfaces wsdd will be listening on. If no interfaces are
     specified, all interfaces are used. The loop-back interface is never used,
     even when it was explicitly specified. For interfaces with IPv6 addresses,
     only link-local addresses will be used for announcing the host on the
     network. This option can be provided multiple times in order to use more
     than one interface.

     This option also accepts IP addresses that the service should bind to.
     For IPv6, only link local addresses are actually considered as noted above.

 * `-l PATH/PORT`, `--listen PATH/PORT`
	 Enable the API server on the with a Unix domain socket on the given PATH
	 or a local TCP socket bound to the given PORT. Refer to the man page for
	 details on the API.

 * `--metadata-timeout TIMEOUT`
     Set the timeout for HTTP-based metadata exchange. Default is 2.0 seconds.

 * `-s`, `--shortlog`

     Use a shorter logging format that only includes the level and message.
     This is useful in cases where the logging mechanism, like systemd on Linux,
     automatically prepend a date and process name plus ID to the log message.

 * `-u USER[:GROUP]`, `--user USER[:GROUP]`

     Change user (and group) when running before handling network packets.
     Together with `-c` this option can be used to increase security if the
     execution environment, like the init system, cannot ensure this in
     another way.

 * `-U UUID`, `--uuid UUID`

     The WSD specification requires a device to have a unique address that is
     stable across reboots or changes in networks. In the context of the
     standard, it is assumed that this is something like a serial number. Wsdd
     attempts to read the machine ID from `/etc/machine-id` and `/etc/hostid`
     (in that order) before potentially chrooting in another environment. If
     reading the machine ID fails, wsdd falls back to a version 5 UUID with the
     DNS namespace and the host name of the local machine as inputs. Thus, the
     host name should be stable and not be modified, e.g. by DHCP. However, if
     you want wsdd to use a specific UUID you can use this option.

 * `-v`, `--verbose`

     Additively increase verbosity of the log output. A single occurrence of
     -v/--verbose sets the log level to INFO. More -v options set the log level
     to DEBUG.

 * `-V`, `--version`

     Show the version number and exit.

### Host Operation Mode

In host mode, the device running wsdd can be discovered by Windows.

 * `-d DOMAIN`, `--domain DOMAIN`

     Assume that the host running wsdd joined an ADS domain. This will make
     wsdd report the host being a domain member. It disables workgroup
     membership reporting. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted
     to lower case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.

 * `-n HOSTNAME`, `--hostname HOSTNAME`

     Override the host name wsdd uses during discovery. By default the machine's
     host name is used (look at hostname(1)). Only the host name part of a
     possible FQDN will be used in the default case.

 * `-o`, `--no-server`

     Disable host operation mode which is enabled by default. The host will
	 not be discovered by WSD clients when this flag is provided.

 * `-p`, `--preserve-case`

     Preserve the hostname as it is. Without this option, the hostname is
     converted as follows. For workgroup environments (see `-w`) the hostname
     is made upper case by default. Vice versa it is made lower case for usage
     in domains (see `-d`).

 * `-t`, `--nohttp`

     Do not service http requests of the WSD protocol. This option is intended
     for debugging purposes where another process may handle the Get messages.

 * `-w WORKGROUP`, `--workgroup WORKGROUP`

     By default wsdd reports the host is a member of a workgroup rather than a
     domain (use the -d/--domain option to override this). With -w/--workgroup
     the default workgroup name can be changed. The default work group name is
     WORKGROUP. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted to upper
     case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.

### Client / Discovery Operation Mode

This mode allows to search for other WSD-compatible devices.

 * `-D`, `--discovery`

	 Enable discovery mode to search for other WSD hosts/servers. Found servers
	 are printed to stdout with INFO priority. The server interface (see `-l`
	 option) can be used for a programatic interface. Refer to the man page for
	 details of the API.


## Example Usage

 * handle traffic on eth0 only, but only with IPv6 addresses

    `wsdd -i eth0 -6`

    or

    `wsdd --interface eth0 --ipv6only`

 * set the Workgroup according to smb.conf and be verbose

    `SMB_GROUP=$(grep -i '^\s*workgroup\s*=' smb.conf | cut -f2 -d= | tr -d '[:blank:]')`

    `wsdd -v -w $SMB_GROUP`

## Technical Description

(Read the source for more details)

For each specified (or all) network interfaces, except for the loopback, an UDP
multicast socket for message reception, two UDP sockets for replying using
unicast as well as sending multicast traffic, and a listening TCP socket are created. This is done for
both the IPv4 and the IPv6 address family if not configured otherwise by the
command line arguments (see above). Upon startup a _Hello_ message is sent.
When wsdd terminates due to a SIGTERM signal or keyboard interrupt, a graceful
shutdown is performed by sending a _Bye_ message. I/O multiplexing is used to
handle network traffic of the different sockets within a single process.

# Known Issues

## Security

wsdd does not implement any security feature, e.g. by using TLS for the http
service. This is because wsdd's intended usage is within private, i.e. home,
LANs. The _Hello_ message contains the host's transport address, i.e. the IP
address, which speeds up discovery (avoids _Resolve_ message).

In order to increase the security, use the capabilities of the init system or
consider the `-u` and `-c` options to drop privileges and chroot.

## Usage with NATs

Do not use wssd on interfaces that are affected by NAT. According to the
standard, the _ResolveMatch_ messages emitted by wsdd contain the IP address
("transport address" in standard parlance) of the interface(s) the application
has been bound to. When such messages are retrieved by a client (Windows
hosts, e.g.) they are unlikely to be able to connect to the provided address
which has been subject to NAT. To avoid this issue, use the `-i/--interface`
option to bind wsdd to interfaces not affected by NAT.

## Tunnel/Bridge Interface

If tunnel/bridge interfaces like those created by OpenVPN or Docker exist, they
may interfere with wsdd if executed without providing an interface that it
should bind to (so it binds to all). In such cases, the wsdd hosts appears after
wsdd has been started but it disappears when an update of the Network view in
Windows Explorer is forced, either by refreshing the view or by a reboot of the
Windows machine.  To solve this issue, the interface that is connected to the
network on which the host should be announced needs to be specified with the
`-i/--interface` option.  This prevents the usage of the tunnel/bridge
interfaces.

Background: Tunnel/bridge interfaces may cause Resolve requests from Windows
hosts to be delivered to wsdd multiple times,´i.e. duplicates of such request
are created. If wsdd receives such a request first from a tunnel/bridge it uses
the transport address (IP address) of that interface and sends the response via
unicast. Further duplicates are not processed due to the duplicate message
detection which is based on message UUIDs. The Windows host which receives the
response appears to detect a mismatch between the transport address in the
ResolveMatch message (which is the tunnel/bridge address) and the IP of the
sending host/interface (LAN IP, e.g.). Subsequently, the wsdd host is ignored by
Windows.
