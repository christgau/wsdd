.TH wsdd 1
.SH NAME
wsdd \- A Web Service Discovery host and client daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wsdd [\fBoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B wsdd
implements both a Web Service Discovery (WSD) host and a WSD client daemon. The
host implementation enables (Samba) hosts, like your local NAS device, to be
found by Web Service Discovery clients like Windows. The client mode allows
searching for other WSD hosts on the local network.
.PP
The default mode of operation is the host mode. The client or discovery mode
must be enabled explictely. Unless configured otherwise, the host mode is always
active. Both modes can be used at the same time.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS General options
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4only\fR
See below.
.TP
\fB\-6\fR, \fB\-\-ipv6only\fR
Restrict to the given address family. If both options are specified no
addreses will be available and wsdd will exit.
.TP
\fB\-c \fIDIRECTORY\fR, \fB\-\-chroot \fIDIRECTORY\fR
chroot into the given \fIDIRECTORY\fR after initialization has been performed
and right before the handling of incoming messages starts. The new root directory
can be empty. Consider using the \fB-u\fR option as well.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Show help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-H \fIHOPLIMIT\fR, \fB\-\-hoplimit \fIHOPLIMIT\fR
Set the hop limit for multicast packets. The default is 1 which should
prevent packets from leaving the local network segment.
.TP
\fB\-i \fIINTERFACE/ADDRESS\fR, \fB\-\-interface \fIINTERFACE/ADDRESS\fR
Specify on which interfaces wsdd will be listening on. If no interfaces are
specified, all interfaces are used. Loop-back interfaces are never used,
even when explicitly specified. For interfaces with IPv6 addresses,
only link-local addresses will be used for announcing the host on the
network. This option can be provided multiple times in order to restrict
traffic to more than one interface.
This option also accepts IP addresses that the service should bind to.
For IPv6, only link local addresses are actually considered as noted above.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shortlog\fR
Use a shorter logging format that only includes the level and message.
This is useful in cases where the logging mechanism, like systemd on Linux,
automatically prepends a date and process name plus ID to the log message.
.TP
\fB\-u \fIUSER[:GROUP]\fR, \fB\-\-user \fIUSER[:GROUP]\fR
Change user (and group) when running before handling network packets.
Together with \fB\-c\fR this option can be used to increase security
if the execution environment, like the init system, cannot ensure this in
another way.
.TP
\fB\-U \fIUUID\fR, \fB\-\-uuid \fIUUID\fR
The WSD specification requires a device to have a unique address that is
stable across reboots or changes in networks. In the context of the
standard, it is assumed that this is something like a serial number. wsdd
uses the UUID version 5 with the DNS namespace and the host name of the
local machine as inputs. Thus, the host name should be stable and not be
modified, e.g. by DHCP. However, if you want wsdd to use a specific UUID
you can use this option.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Additively increase verbosity of the log output. A single occurrence of
-v/--verbose sets the log level to INFO. More -v options set the log level
to DEBUG.
.SS Host Mode Options
.TP
\fB\-d \fIDOMAIN\fR, \fB\-\-domain \fIDOMAIN\fR
Assume that the host running wsdd joined an ADS domain. This will make
wsdd report the host being a domain member. It disables workgroup
membership reporting. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted
to lower case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.
.TP
\fB\-n \fIHOSTNAME\fR, \fB\-\-hostname \fIHOSTNAME\fR
Override the host name wsdd uses during discovery. By default the machine's
host name is used (look at hostname(1)). Only the host name part of a
possible FQDN will be used in the default case.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-no-host\fR
Disable host operation mode. If this option is provided, the host cannot be
discovered by other (Windows) hosts. It can be useful when client/discovery
mode is used and no announcement of the host that runs wsdd should be made.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve-case\fR
Preserve the hostname as it is. Without this option, the hostname is
converted as follows. For workgroup environments (see -w) the hostname
is made upper case by default. Vice versa it is made lower case for usage
in domains (see -d).
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-no-http\fR
Do not service HTTP requests of the WSD protocol. This option is intended
for debugging purposes where another process may handle the Get messages.
.TP
\fB\-w \fIWORKGROUP\fR, \fB\-\-workgroup \fIWORKGROUP\fR
By default wsdd reports the host is a member of a workgroup rather than a
domain (use the -d/--domain option to override this). With -w/--workgroup
the default workgroup name can be changed. The default work group name is
WORKGROUP. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted to upper
case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.
.SS Client/Discovery Mode Options
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-discovery\fR
Enable discovery mode to search for other WSD hosts/servers. Found hosts
are logged with INFO priority. The server interface (see below)
can be used for a programatic interface. Refer to the man page for
details of the server interface.
.TP
\fB\-l \fIPATH/PORT\fR, \fB\-\-listen \fIPATH/PORT\fR
Specify the location of the socket for the server programming interface.
If the option value is numeric, it is interpreted as numeric port for a
TCP server port. Then, the server socket is bound to the localhost only.
If the option value is non-numeric, it is assumed to be a path to UNIX
domain socket to which a client can connect to.

.SH EXAMPLE USAGE
.SS Handle traffic on eth0 and eth2 only, but only with IPv6 addresses

    wsdd \-i eth0 \-i eth2 \-6

    or

    wsdd \-\-interface eth0 \-\-interface eth2 \-\-ipv6only
.SS Set the Workgroup according to smb.conf, be verbose, run with dropped privileges, and change the root directory to an (empty) directory

    SMB_GROUP=$(grep \-i '^\s*workgroup\s*=' smb.conf | cut \-f2 \-d= | tr \-d '[:blank:]')

    wsdd \-v \-w $SMB_GROUP -u daemon:daemon -c /var/run/wsdd/chroot
.SH FIREWALL SETUP
.PP
Both incoming and outgoing multicast traffic on port 3702 must be allowed. For
IPv4, the multicast address is `239.255.255.250`, for IPv6 the link local SSDP
multicast address (`fe02::c`) is used. Outgoing unicast UDP traffic from port
3702 must be allowed too.
.PP
Incoming TCP traffic (and related outgoing traffic) on port 5357 must be
allowed.
.SH SERVER INTERFACE
When the discovery mode is used, wsdd provides a text-based line-oriented
server interface to query information and trigger actions. The interface can be
used with TCP and UNIX domain sockets (see above). The TCP socket is bound to
the local host only. The following commands can be issued:
.SS probe - Search for devices
\fBprobe \fI[INTERFACE]\fR

Triggers a Probe message on the provided INTERFACE (eth0, e.g.) to search for
WSD hosts. If no interface is provided, all interfaces wsdd listens on are probed.
A Probe messages initiates the discovery message flow. It may take some time for
hosts to be actually discovered.
.SS list - List discovered devices
\fBlist\fR

Returns a tab-separated list of discovered devices with the following information:
.TP
UUID
UUID of the discovered device. Note that a multi-homed device should appear
only once but with multiple addresses (see below)
.TP
name
The name reported by the device. For discovered Windows hosts, it is the
configured computer name that is reported here.
.TP
association
Specifies the domain or workgroup to which the discovered host belongs to.  The
type of the association (workgroup or domain) is separated from its value by a
colon.
.TP
last_seen
The date and time the device was last seen as a consequence of Probe/Hello
messages provided in ISO8601 with seconds.
.TP
addresses
List of all transport addresses that were collected during the discovery
process delimited by commas.  Addresses are provided along with the interface
(separated by '%') on which they were discovered.  IPv6 addresses are reported
on square brackets. Note that the reported addresses may not match the actual
device on which the device may be reached.
.SS clear - Clear list of discovered devices \fBclear\fR

Clears the list of all discovered devices. Use the \fBprobe\fR command to search
for devices again.
.SH SECURITY
.PP
wsdd does not implement any security feature, e.g. by using TLS for the http
service. This is because wsdd's intended usage is within private, i.e. home,
LANs. The \fIHello\fR message contains the hosts transport address, i.e. the IP
address which speeds up discovery (avoids \fIResolve\fR message).
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.SS Using only IPv6 on FreeBSD
If wsdd is running on FreeBSD using IPv6 only, the host running wsdd may not be
reliably discovered. The reason appears to be that Windows is not always able
to connect to the HTTP service for unknown reasons. As a workaround, run wsdd
with IPv4 only.
.SS Tunnel/Bridge Interface
.PP
If tunnel/bridge interfaces like those created by OpenVPN or Docker exist, they
may interfere with wsdd if executed without providing an interface that it
should bind to (so it binds to all). In such cases, the wsdd hosts appears after
wsdd has been started but it disappears when an update of the Network view in
Windows Explorer is forced, either by refreshing the view or by a reboot of the
Windows machine.  To solve this issue, the interface that is connected to the
network on which the host should be announced needs to be specified with the
-i/--interface option.  This prevents the usage of the tunnel/bridge
interfaces.
.PP
Background: Tunnel/bridge interfaces may cause \fIResolve\fR requests from Windows
hosts to be delivered to wsdd multiple times, i.e. duplicates of such request
are created. If wsdd receives such a request first from a tunnel/bridge it uses
the transport address (IP address) of that interface and sends the response via
unicast. Further duplicates are not processed due to the duplicate message
detection which is based on message UUIDs. The Windows host which receives the
response appears to detect a mismatch between the transport address in the
\fIResolveMatch\fR message (which is the tunnel/bridge address) and the IP of the
sending host/interface (LAN IP, e.g.). Subsequently, the wsdd host is ignored by
Windows.
