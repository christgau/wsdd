.SH NAME
wsdd \- A Web Service Discovery host daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B wsdd [\fBoptions\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B wsdd
implements a Web Service Discovery host daemon. This enables (Samba)
hosts, like your local NAS device, to be found by Web Service Discovery Clients
like Windows.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-4\fR, \fB\-\-ipv4only\fR
See below.
.TP
\fB\-6\fR, \fB\-\-ipv6only\fR
Restrict to the given address family. If both options are specified no
addreses will be available and wsdd will exit.
.TP
\fB\-c \fIDIRECTORY\fR, \fB\-\-chroot \fIDIRECTORY\fR
chroot into the given \fIDIRECTORY\fR after initialization has been performed
and right before the handling of incoming messages starts. The new root directory
can be empty. Consider using the \fB-u\fR option as well.
.TP
\fB\-d \fIDOMAIN\fR, \fB\-\-domain \fIDOMAIN\fR
Assume that the host running wsdd joined an ADS domain. This will make
wsdd report the host being a domain member. It disables workgroup
membership reporting. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted
to lower case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.
.TP
\fB\-H \fIHOPLIMIT\fR, \fB\-\-hoplimit \fIHOPLIMIT\fR
Set the hop limit for multicast packets. The default is 1 which should
prevent packets from leaving the local network segment.
.TP
\fB\-i \fIINTERFACE\fR, \fB\-\-interface \fIINTERFACE\fR
Specify on which interfaces wsdd will be listening on. If no interfaces are
specified, all interfaces are used. The loop-back interface is never used,
even when it was explicitly specified. For interfaces with IPv6 addresses,
only link-local addresses will be used for announcing the host on the
network. This option can be provided multiple times in order to use more
than interface (but no all).
.TP
\fB\-n \fIHOSTNAME\fR, \fB\-\-hostname \fIHOSTNAME\fR
Override the host name wsdd uses during discovery. By default the machine's
host name is used (look at hostname(1)). Only the host name part of a
possible FQDN will be used in the default case.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-preserve-case\fR
Preserve the hostname as it is. Without this option, the hostname is
converted as follows. For workgroup environments (see -w) the hostname
is made upper case by default. Vice versa it is made lower case for usage
in domains (see -d).
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shortlog\fR
Use a shorter logging format that only includes the level and message.
This is useful in cases where the logging mechanism, like systemd on Linux,
automatically prepends a date and process name plus ID to the log message.
.TP
\fB\-t\fI\fR, \fI\fB\-\-nohttp\fR
Do not service HTTP requests of the WSD protocol. This option is intended
for debugging purposes where another process may handle the Get messages.
.TP
\fB\-u \fIUSER[:GROUP]\fR, \fB\-\-user \fIUSER[:GROUP]\fR
Change user (and group) when running before handling network packets.
Together with \fB\-c\fR this option can be used to increase security
if the execution environment, like the init system, cannot ensure this in
another way.
.TP
\fB\-U \fIUUID\fR, \fB\-\-uuid \fIUUID\fR
The WSD specification requires a device to have a unique address that is
stable across reboots or changes in networks. In the context of the
standard, it is assumed that this is something like a serial number. wsdd
uses the UUID version 5 with the DNS namespace and the host name of the
local machine as inputs. Thus, the host name should be stable and not be
modified, e.g. by DHCP. However, if you want wsdd to use a specific UUID
you can use this option.
.TP
\fB\-v\fI\fR, \fI\fB\-\-verbose\fR
Additively increase verbosity of the log output. A single occurrence of
-v/--verbose sets the log level to INFO. More -v options set the log level
to DEBUG.
.TP
\fB\-w \fIWORKGROUP\fR, \fB\-\-workgroup \fIWORKGROUP\fR
By default wsdd reports the host is a member of a workgroup rather than a
domain (use the -d/--domain option to override this). With -w/--workgroup
the default workgroup name can be changed. The default work group name is
WORKGROUP. The (provided) hostname is automatically converted to upper
case. Use the `-p` option to change this behavior.
.SH EXAMPLE USAGE
.SS Handle traffic on eth0 and eth2 only, but only with IPv6 addresses

    wsdd \-i eth0 \-i eth2 \-6

    or

    wsdd \-\-interface eth0 \-\-interface eth2 \-\-ipv6only
.SS Set the Workgroup according to smb.conf, be verbose, run with dropped privileges, and change the root directory to an (empty) directory

    SMB_GROUP=$(grep \-i '^\s*workgroup\s*=' smb.conf | cut \-f2 \-d= | tr \-d '[:blank:]')

    wsdd \-v \-w $SMB_GROUP -u daemon:daemon -c /var/run/wsdd/chroot
.SH FIREWALL SETUP
.PP
Both incoming and outgoing multicast traffic on port 3702 must be allowed. For
IPv4, the multicast address is `239.255.255.250`, for IPv6 the link local SSDP
multicast address (`fe02::c`) is used.
.PP
Incoming TCP traffic (and related outgoing traffic) on port 5357 must be
allowed.
.SH SECURITY
.PP
wsdd does not implement any security feature, e.g. by using TLS for the http
service. This is because wsdd's intended usage is within private, i.e. home,
LANs. The \fIHello\fR message contains the hosts transport address, i.e. the IP
address which speeds up discovery (avoids \fIResolve\fR message).
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
.SS Using only IPv6 on FreeBSD
If wsdd is running on FreeBSD using IPv6 only, the host running wsdd may not be
reliably discovered. The reason appears to be that Windows is not always able
to connect to the HTTP service for unknown reasons. As a workaround, run wsdd
with IPv4 only.
.SS Tunnel/Bridge Interface
.PP
If tunnel/bridge interfaces like those created by OpenVPN or Docker exist, they
may interfere with wsdd if executed without providing an interface that it
should bind to (so it binds to all). In such cases, the wsdd hosts appears after
wsdd has been started but it disappears when an update of the Network view in
Windows Explorer is forced, either by refreshing the view or by a reboot of the
Windows machine.  To solve this issue, the interface that is connected to the
network on which the host should be announced needs to be specified with the
-i/--interface option.  This prevents the usage of the tunnel/bridge
interfaces.
.PP
Background: Tunnel/bridge interfaces may cause \fIResolve\fR requests from Windows
hosts to be delivered to wsdd multiple times, i.e. duplicates of such request
are created. If wsdd receives such a request first from a tunnel/bridge it uses
the transport address (IP address) of that interface and sends the response via
unicast. Further duplicates are not processed due to the duplicate message
detection which is based on message UUIDs. The Windows host which receives the
response appears to detect a mismatch between the transport address in the
\fIResolveMatch\fR message (which is the tunnel/bridge address) and the IP of the
sending host/interface (LAN IP, e.g.). Subsequently, the wsdd host is ignored by
Windows.
